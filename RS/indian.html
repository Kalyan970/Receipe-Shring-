2.All-purpose Flour - 1/4 cup<br>
3.Baking Soda - 1/4 teaspoon<br>
4.Ghee or Warm Milk - For kneading the dough (about 2-3 tablespoons)<br>

For the Sugar Syrup:<br>

1.Sugar - 2 cups<br>
2.Water - 1 cup<br>
3.Cardamom Powder - 1/4 teaspoon<br>
4.Rose Water (optional) - 1-2 teaspoons for fragrance" data-instructions="1.Making the Sugar Syrup:<br>

2.In a pan, add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water.<br>
3.Heat the mixture on medium flame, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves completely.<br>
4.Once the syrup starts to boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5-6 minutes until the syrup thickens slightly.<br>
5.Add the cardamom powder and rose water (if using). Stir well and remove from heat.<br>
6.Keep the syrup warm (it should be warm, not hot, when soaking the fried gulab jamuns).<br>
     Preparing the Gulab Jamun Dough:<br>

1.In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, flour, and baking soda.<br>
2.Slowly add ghee or warm milk, a little at a time, to knead into a smooth, soft dough. The dough should be soft and smooth but not sticky. If needed, add a little more warm milk or ghee to achieve the right consistency.<br>
3.Let the dough rest for 10-15 minutes, covered with a damp cloth.<br>

    Shaping and Frying the Gulab Jamuns:<br>

1.After resting the dough, grease your palms with ghee or oil.<br>
2.Take small portions of the dough and roll them into smooth, crack-free balls. Ensure the balls are small, as they will double in size when fried and soaked in syrup.<br>
3.Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan on low to medium heat.<br>
4.Test the oil by dropping a small piece of dough into it—if it rises slowly to the surface, the oil is at the right temperature.<br>
5.Carefully drop the gulab jamun balls into the hot oil. Fry them in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.<br>
6.Keep stirring gently to ensure even frying. Fry until they turn golden brown on all sides. This should take around 6-8 minutes on low heat.<br>
7.Remove the fried gulab jamuns and drain excess oil on a paper towel.<br>
 Soaking in Sugar Syrup:<br>

1.While the gulab jamuns are still warm, place them directly into the warm sugar syrup.
Let the gulab jamuns soak in the syrup for at least 1 hour. The balls will absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy. .">Gulab Jamun</h3>
